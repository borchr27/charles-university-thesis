overfitting is possible bc the new data set performed worse 
UGHDONE check fit on train data for vectorizer
DONE dont include test data from x-pal_original in plots
does xpal make sense with this data
DONE modify accuracy score to include sample weight
DONE need to commit probal changes
need to do experiments using less categories with PWC (on data with over 40 data points)
revisit using LSCV with bagging

RERUN original and all_data experiments
FIX sampling strategy plots and distribution plot
CONCLUSION
