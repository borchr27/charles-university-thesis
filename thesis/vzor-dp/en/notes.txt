DONE noted overfitting bc the new data set performed worse
DONE check fit on train data for vectorizer
DONE dont include test data from x-pal_original in plots
DONE does xpal make sense with this data
DONE modify accuracy score to include sample weight
DONE need to commit probal changes
DONE need to do experiments using less cats with PWC (on data with over 40 data points)
DONE revisit using LSCV with bagging
DONE original and all_data experiments
DONE fix sampling strategy plots and distribution plot
DONE NO Try with LN-LTSM with word embedding
DONE update the abstract
DONE add more to conclusion
DONE TODO chi squared using all data
DONE add links to repos into thesis
DONE Define variable importance in section 3
DONE Check out mcnemars/fisher test instead of chi squared
DONE check the plagirism score
DONE Add fisher exact test to section 3
DONE print and read thru thesis
DONE wait for experiments to rerun then update plots
DONE related works
DONE TODO page 32 where we talk about the vectorizer
DONE TODO min category plot to have num of categories instead of min samples
DONE check if thesis is PDF/A (all good)
DONE print off second copy of official paper for thesis
DONE email Dateio about thesis
DONE submit for more file extensions
DONE upload .csv files and results and data to github probal fork
DONE make PDF/A compatible
PENDING try to get LSVC to work in probabl repo
PENDING test with active learning ml repo

DONE page 8 section 1.2.3
DONE page 12 in table why R^x_0?
DONE equation 2.1 make y small index and check in xpal paper
DONE add \hbox{.} into equations 2.2 and 2.16
DONE equation 2.18 we dont number same equation twice
DONE missing parenthesis in equation 2.20
DONE parenthesis in TFIDF equations on page 20
DONE page 38, should say linearly seperable
DONE isnt to isn't
DONE 4.1 remove 'either' and TODO sentence
DONE LOSS in defining xpal, some places its bold some places its not bold
DONE equation on page 30 line 7 ( (X data size//batch size ∗ numepochs).) and double slash
DONE add bagging code snippet into appendix
DONE We weren’t satisfied with the testing error which plateaued around 70%. on page 24 and explain the budget and how it works as labeled training data samples
DONE remove 'as a result' in section 2.3 and define t(x) in a sentence
DONE its possible to do incremental learning with svc and talk about it for future work / in conclusion
DONE check variable importance whether its relative or how its scaled 4.4.2 (should be fine, no scaling)
DONE define crammer singer, balanced svc isn't in the table, cosine decay weights definition may be wrong (check it) on page 29 (fixed definition and took out crammer singer)

TODO submit on SIS on Tuesday May 2nd (due 4) code(x2) and pdf thesis and abstract
TODO get 2 bound copies and submit on 4th floor by May 7th (due 9)
